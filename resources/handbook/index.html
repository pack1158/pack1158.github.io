<h1 id="pack-1158-handbook">Pack 1158 Handbook</h1>
<p>As a parent, you want your son to grow up to be a person of worth; a
self-reliant, dependable, and caring individual. Scouting has these same goals
in mind for him. Since 1910, we have been weaving lifetime values into fun and
educational activities designed to assist parents in strengthening character,
developing good citizenship, and enhancing physical fitness in youth.</p>
<p>These values help your son make good decisions throughout his lifetime and give
him confidence as he becomes an adult leader of tomorrow. With all the negative
influences in today’s society, Scouting provides your son with a positive peer
group and a program that is fun and adventurous and helps him to “be prepared”
to shape his own future.</p>
<h2 id="scout-basics">Scout Basics</h2>
<p>Your Boy is a Member of a <strong>Den</strong> (he will be assigned an existing den or a new
den will be formed).</p>
<ul>
<li>A den has usually up to 8 boys</li>
<li>The den meets 2-3 times a month</li>
<li>The den is led by a den leader and an assistant (parents or adults connected
  to boys in the Pack).</li>
<li>The den may also be assisted by a den chief (an older Boy Scout).</li>
</ul>
<p>Your Boy (and his Den) is a Member of a <strong>Pack</strong> (we are Pack 1158).</p>
<ul>
<li>A pack is made up of all the dens.</li>
<li>The pack meets once a month (the 3rd Wednesday of each month at 7pm at
  Ashburn Elementary School). All Cub Scout families attend.</li>
<li>Pack meetings have games, skits, songs, ceremonies, and presentations of
  badges that the boys earned that month.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Pack is Run by the <strong>Pack Committee</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>The pack committee is made up of a group of adults that administer the
  program of the pack. Usually committee members, as well as other pack
  leaders, are parents or family of boys in the pack.</li>
<li>The committee meets once month (1st Wednesday of each month at 7pm at AES).</li>
<li>The committee is led by a Committee Chairperson.</li>
<li>The committee selects leaders, performs record keeping, manages pack
  finances, orders badges, maintains pack equipment, helps train leaders, and
  recognizes leaders.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Pack is Owned by the <strong>Chartered Organization</strong> (our Organization is the
Dulles International Airport Rotary Club).</p>
<ul>
<li>Chartered organizations include schools, parent-school associations,
  religious organizations, service clubs, and other groups interested in
  youth.</li>
<li>The chartered organization approves leaders, provides a meeting place, and
  operates packs within the guidelines and policies of the chartered
  organization and the Boy scouts of America.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pack-structure">Pack Structure</h2>
<p>Within each Pack, the boys are divided into dens according to grade level. Dens
will consist of 5-8 boys. Each den will have at least one BSA-registered adult
leader and assistant leader.</p>
<p>Any boy who is 5 years old or in Kindergarten may join Cub Scouts. Ranks are as
follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Rank</th>
<th align="left">Grade</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">Lion</td>
<td align="left">Kindergarten</td>

<tr>
<td align="left">Tiger</td>
<td align="left">1st Grade</td>

<td align="left">5th Grade</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each Scout needs a BSA Scout book for his rank. The book outlines the program
for the year and specific rank requirements.</p>
<h2 id="den-meetings">Den Meetings</h2>
<p>Days, times, and locations of den meetings are determined by the Den Leader and
den parents.</p>
<p>Den Leaders are responsible for coordinating den activities; however, parents
will be called upon to assist as needed. This may mean helping with a den
meeting or providing snacks. Your den leader will hold a parent meeting to
discuss parent participation and support.</p>
<p>Due to BSA Youth Protection Guidelines, <strong>no den meeting may take place without
two-deep adult leadership</strong>. This means one registered Scout volunteer and at
least one other adult must be present at any den activity. <strong>There are no
exceptions to this rule.</strong></p>
<h2 id="pack-meetings">Pack Meetings</h2>
<p>Pack meetings are held on the 3rd Wednesday of each month during the school
year. Pack 1158 meets in the cafeteria of Ashburn Elementary School from
7:00-8:00pm.</p>
<p>All boys should wear their Class A uniforms to the Pack meetings. Pack meetings
are an opportunity for dens to gather and recognize the achievements of other
Scouts (or their own achievements). Pack meetings begin with a flag ceremony,
usually followed by Scout skits, announcements, and presentations of awards.</p>
<p>Award ceremonies are an important part of Pack 1158 meetings. Pack leaders
strive to make rank ceremonies as memorable as possible. Please make every
effort to ensure your son’s and your attendance at these meetings. Family
attendance is also encouraged at Pack meetings. Boys love to get awards and to
be recognized in front of their family. Each Scout must have at least one
parent or guardian in attendance.</p>
<h2 id="uniform">Uniform</h2>
<h3 id="bsa-field-uniform">BSA Field Uniform</h3>
<p>The BSA Field uniform (formally known as Class A, detailed below) should be
worn to all official Scout functions: den meetings, pack meetings, field trips,
etc., unless otherwise noted by the den leader. Scouts can also wear their
uniform to school on pack meeting day. BSA Field uniforms must include all
items (as listed). Scout pants are not required, but green, navy, or khaki
pants/shorts must be worn. Sweat pants, running pants, sport uniform
pants/shorts, swim gear or athletic shorts of any kind are NOT acceptable.
Sneaker and hiking boots are accepted as footwear. Sandals, flip-flops, and
cleats are not acceptable.</p>

<h3 id="activity-uniform">Activity Uniform</h3>
<p>The Activity Uniform (Formally known as Class B, Pack t-shirts) are appropriate
at summer events and the “messier” activities. Activity t-shirts are provided
upon receipt of the Pack dues.</p>
<h2 id="family-involvement">Family Involvement</h2>
<p>The family is the basis of Cub Scouting. The most important help that you, as a
parent, can give your boys is to work with him on his Cub Scouting activities.
Being active in his den activities will help you in your understanding of all
that he is achieving.</p>
<h2 id="volunteering">Volunteering</h2>
<p>The Pack 1158 leadership is 100% volunteer driven, and help with the planning
and implementation of activities is welcomed and encouraged. Your son’s den and
the pack rely on parent participation to run a successful program. We are
always searching for people to fill den leader, committee, or event positions.
Pack 1158 requires every scout family to volunteer for at least one pack
activity and attend at least one committee meeting per year. Please contact any
leader for a full list of volunteer opportunities. </p>
<p>Your role as a parent is the secret to a successful Cub Scouting program! It is
proven that the more active a parent is in scouting, the more likely a boy is
to continue on in scouting. It is fun and offers great rewards!</p>
<h2 id="training">Training</h2>
<p>Scouting offers a wide range of training including Youth Protection Training.
We encourage all parents/adult family members/guardians to take this training.
It is an online training found at
<a href="http://www.scouting.org/training/youthprotection.aspx">www.scouting.org/training/youthprotection.aspx</a>.
It is required for all BSA registered volunteers. It is a great tool for
everyone involved as it provides an understanding of the policies put forth by
the scouting program in protection of our boys.</p>
<h2 id="fees">Fees</h2>
<p>The Pack collects dues at the start of each scouting year (October) to cover
the expenses of the Pack. This includes the annual national registration fee to
become a Scout, insurance, and the annual subscription to Boys Life magazine.
Other costs that are covered by the Pack include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cub Scout handbook</li>
<li>Class B Pack t-shirt</li>
<li>Scouting awards</li>
<li>Blue &amp; Gold Celebration and Pinewood Derby</li>
<li>Adult leader registration fees</li>
<li>Other events and activities</li>
</ul>

scout.</p></div>

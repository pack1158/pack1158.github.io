Scouting has these same goals\nin mind for him. Since 1910, we have been weaving lifetime values into fun and\neducational activities designed to assist parents in strengthening character,\ndeveloping good citizenship, and enhancing physical fitness in youth.\n\n\nThese values help your son make good decisions throughout his lifetime and give\nhim confidence as he becomes an adult leader of tomorrow. With all the negative\ninfluences in today\u2019s society, Scouting provides your son with a positive peer\ngroup and a program that is fun and adventurous and helps him to \u201cbe prepared\u201d\nto shape his own future.\n\n\nScout Basics\n\n\nYour Boy is a Member of a \nDen\n (he will be assigned an existing den or a new\nden will be formed).\n\n\n\n\nA den has usually up to 8 boys\n\n\nThe den meets 2-3 times a month (2nd and 4th Tuesdays at 6:45pm at Ashburn\n  Elementary, along with occasional weekend/ad hoc times/locations).\n\n\nThe den is led by a den leader and an assistant (parents or adults connected\n  to boys in the Pack).\n\n\nThe den may also be assisted by a den chief (an older Boy Scout).\n\n\n\n\nYour Boy (and his Den) is a Member of a \nPack\n (we are Pack 1158).\n\n\n\n\nA pack is made up of all the dens.\n\n\nThe pack meets once a month (the 3rd Tuesday of each month at 6:45pm at\n  Ashburn Elementary School). All Cub Scout families attend.\n\n\nPack meetings have games, skits, songs, ceremonies, and presentations of\n  badges that the boys earned that month.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pack is Run by the \nPack Committee\n \n\n\n\n\nThe pack committee is made up of a group of adults that administer the\n  program of the pack. Usually committee members, as well as other pack\n  leaders, are parents or family of boys in the pack.\n\n\nThe committee meets once month (1st Tuesday of each month at 7pm at AES).\n\n\nThe committee is led by a Committee Chairperson.\n\n\nThe committee selects leaders, performs record keeping, manages pack\n  finances, orders badges, maintains pack equipment, helps train leaders, and\n  recognizes leaders.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pack is Owned by the \nChartered Organization\n (our Organization is the\nDulles International Airport Rotary Club).\n\n\n\n\nChartered organizations include schools, parent-school associations,\n  religious organizations, service clubs, and other groups interested in\n  youth.\n\n\nThe chartered organization approves leaders, provides a meeting place, and\n  operates packs within the guidelines and policies of the chartered\n  organization and the Boy scouts of America.\n\n\n\n\nPack Structure\n\n\nWithin each Pack, the boys are divided into dens according to grade level. Dens\nwill consist of 5-8 boys. Each den will have at least one BSA-registered adult\nleader and assistant leader.\n\n\nAny boy who is 5 years old or in Kindergarten may join Cub Scouts. Ranks are as\nfollows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nGrade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLion\n\n\nKindergarten\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger\n\n\n1st Grade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWolf\n\n\n2nd Grade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBear\n\n\n3rd Grade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebelos\n\n\n4th Grade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrow of Light\n\n\n5th Grade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach Scout needs a BSA Scout book for his rank. The book outlines the program\nfor the year and specific rank requirements.\n\n\nDen Meetings\n\n\nDays, times, and locations of den meetings are determined by the Den Leader and\nden parents.\n\n\nDen Leaders are responsible for coordinating den activities; however, parents\nwill be called upon to assist as needed. This may mean helping with a den\nmeeting or providing snacks. Your den leader will hold a parent meeting to\ndiscuss parent participation and support.\n\n\nDue to BSA Youth Protection Guidelines, \nno den meeting may take place without\ntwo-deep adult leadership\n. This means one registered Scout volunteer and at\nleast one other adult must be present at any den activity. \nThere are no\nexceptions to this rule.\n\n\nPack Meetings\n\n\nPack meetings are held on the 3rd Tuesday of each month during the school\nyear. Pack 1158 meets in the cafeteria of Ashburn Elementary School from\n6:45-8:00pm.\n\n\nAll boys should wear their Class A uniforms to the Pack meetings. Pack meetings\nare an opportunity for dens to gather and recognize the achievements of other\nScouts (or their own achievements). Pack meetings begin with a flag ceremony,\nusually followed by Scout skits, announcements, and presentations of awards.\n\n\nAward ceremonies are an important part of Pack 1158 meetings. Pack leaders\nstrive to make rank ceremonies as memorable as possible. Please make every\neffort to ensure your son\u2019s and your attendance at these meetings. Family\nattendance is also encouraged at Pack meetings. Boys love to get awards and to\nbe recognized in front of their family. Each Scout must have at least one\nparent or guardian in attendance.\n\n\nUniform\n\n\nBSA Field Uniform\n\n\nThe BSA Field uniform (formally known as Class A, detailed below) should be\nworn to all official Scout functions: den meetings, pack meetings, field trips,\netc., unless otherwise noted by the den leader. Scouts can also wear their\nuniform to school on pack meeting day. BSA Field uniforms must include all\nitems (as listed). Scout pants are not required, but green, navy, or khaki\npants/shorts must be worn. Sweat pants, running pants, sport uniform\npants/shorts, swim gear or athletic shorts of any kind are NOT acceptable.\nSneaker and hiking boots are accepted as footwear. Sandals, flip-flops, and\ncleats are not acceptable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\n\n\nCost (Lion)\n\n\nCost (Tiger, Wolf, Bear)\n\n\nCost (Webelos, Arrow of Light)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShirt\n\n\n(t-shirt) $10\n\n\n(blue) $25\n\n\n(tan) $30\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHat\n\n\n$13\n\n\n$15\n\n\n$15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeckerchief\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n$9\n\n\n$9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeckerchief Slide\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n$6\n\n\n$6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelt\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n$10\n\n\n$10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniform Patches\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n$10-15 (total)\n\n\n$10-15 (total)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n$23\n\n\n$75-80\n\n\n$80-85\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniform supplies can be purchased at:\n\n\nOnline: \nwww.scoutstuff.org\n\n\nNational Capital Area Council Scout Shop\n\n9190 Rockville Pike\n\nBethesda, MD 20814\n\n(301) 564 1091\n\n\nNorthern Virginia Scout Shop\n\n5253 Port Royal Road\n\nSpringfield VA 22151\n\n(703) 321 4836\n\n\nLeesburg Hobbies & Collectibles\n\n9 West Market Street\n\nLeesburg, VA 20176\n\n(703) 779 8600 (Call for hours of operation)\n\n\nwww.leesburghobbies.com\n\n\nActivity Uniform\n\n\nThe Activity Uniform (Formally known as Class B, Pack t-shirts) are appropriate\nat summer events and the \u201cmessier\u201d activities.

The most important help that you, as a\nparent, can give your boys is to work with him on his Cub Scouting activities.\nBeing active in his den activities will help you in your understanding of all\nthat he is achieving.\n\n\nVolunteering\n\n\nThe Pack 1158 leadership is 100% volunteer driven, and help with the planning\nand implementation of activities is welcomed and encouraged. Your son\u2019s den and\nthe pack rely on parent participation to run a successful program. We are\nalways searching for people to fill den leader, committee, or event positions.\nPack 1158 requires every scout family to volunteer for at least one pack\nactivity and attend at least one committee meeting per year. Please contact any\nleader for a full list of volunteer opportunities. \n\n\nYour role as a parent is the secret to a successful Cub Scouting program! It is\nproven that the more active a parent is in scouting, the more likely a boy is\nto continue on in scouting. It is fun and offers great rewards!\n\n\nTraining\n\n\nScouting offers a wide range of training including Youth Protection Training.\nWe encourage all parents/adult family members/guardians to take this training.\nIt is an online training found at\n\nwww.scouting.org/training/youthprotection.aspx\n.\nIt is required for all BSA registered volunteers. It is a great tool for\neveryone involved as it provides an understanding of the policies put forth by\nthe scouting program in protection of our boys.\n\n\nFees\n\n\nThe Pack collects dues at the start of each scouting year (October) to cover\nthe expenses of the Pack. This includes the annual national registration fee to\nbecome a Scout, insurance, and the annual subscription to Boys Life magazine.\nOther costs that are covered by the Pack include:\n\n\n\n\nCub Scout handbook\n\n\nClass B Pack t-shirt\n\n\nScouting awards\n\n\nBlue & Gold Celebration and Pinewood Derby\n\n\nAdult leader registration fees\n\n\nOther events and activities\n\n\n\n\nFees are non-refundable.

A den has usually up to 8 boys  The den meets 2-3 times a month (2nd and 4th Tuesdays at 6:45pm at Ashburn\n  Elementary, along with occasional weekend/ad hoc times/locations).  The den is led by a den leader and an assistant (parents or adults connected\n  to boys in the Pack).  The den may also be assisted by a den chief (an older Boy Scout).   Your Boy (and his Den) is a Member of a  Pack  (we are Pack 1158).   A pack is made up of all the dens.  The pack meets once a month (the 3rd Tuesday of each month at 6:45pm at\n  Ashburn Elementary School). All Cub Scout families attend.  Pack meetings have games, skits, songs, ceremonies, and presentations of\n  badges that the boys earned that month.   The Pack is Run by the  Pack Committee     The pack committee is made up of a group of adults that administer the\n  program of the pack. Usually committee members, as well as other pack\n  leaders, are parents or family of boys in the pack.  The committee meets once month (1st Tuesday of each month at 7pm at AES).  The committee is led by a Committee Chairperson.  The committee selects leaders, performs record keeping, manages pack\n  finances, orders badges, maintains pack equipment, helps train leaders, and\n  recognizes leaders.   The Pack is Owned by the  Chartered Organization  (our Organization is the\nDulles International Airport Rotary Club).   Chartered organizations include schools, parent-school associations,\n  religious organizations, service clubs, and other groups interested in\n  youth.  The chartered organization approves leaders, provides a meeting place, and\n  operates packs within the guidelines and policies of the chartered\n  organization and the Boy scouts of America.",

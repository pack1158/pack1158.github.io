Scouting has these same goals\nin mind for him. Since 1910, we have been weaving lifetime values into fun and\neducational activities designed to assist parents in strengthening character,\ndeveloping good citizenship, and enhancing physical fitness in youth.\n\n\nThese values help your son make good decisions throughout his lifetime and give\nhim confidence as he becomes an adult leader of tomorrow. With all the negative\ninfluences in today\u2019s society, Scouting provides your son with a positive peer\ngroup and a program that is fun and adventurous and helps him to \u201cbe prepared\u201d\nto shape his own future.\n\n\nScout Basics\n\n\nYour Boy is a Member of a \nDen\n (he will be assigned an existing den or a new\nden will be formed).\n\n\n\n\nA den has usually up to 8 boys\n\n\nThe den meets 2-3 times a month\n\n\nThe den is led by a den leader and an assistant (parents or adults connected\n  to boys in the Pack).\n\n\nThe den may also be assisted by a den chief (an older Boy Scout).\n\n\n\n\nYour Boy (and his Den) is a Member of a \nPack\n (we are Pack 1158).\n\n\n\n\nA pack is made up of all the dens.\n\n\nThe pack meets once a month (the 3rd Wednesday of each month at 7pm at\n  Ashburn Elementary School). All Cub Scout families attend.\n\n\nPack meetings have games, skits, songs, ceremonies, and presentations of\n  badges that the boys earned that month.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pack is Run by the \nPack Committee\n \n\n\n\n\nThe pack committee is made up of a group of adults that administer the\n  program of the pack. Usually committee members, as well as other pack\n  leaders, are parents or family of boys in the pack.\n\n\nThe committee meets once month (1st Wednesday of each month at 7pm at AES).\n\n\nThe committee is led by a Committee Chairperson.\n\n\nThe committee selects leaders, performs record keeping, manages pack\n  finances, orders badges, maintains pack equipment, helps train leaders, and\n  recognizes leaders.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pack is Owned by the \nChartered Organization\n (our Organization is the\nDulles International Airport Rotary Club).\n\n\n\n\nChartered organizations include schools, parent-school associations,\n  religious organizations, service clubs, and other groups interested in\n  youth.\n\n\nThe chartered organization approves leaders, provides a meeting place, and\n  operates packs within the guidelines and policies of the chartered\n  organization and the Boy scouts of America.\n\n\n\n\nPack Structure\n\n\nWithin each Pack, the boys are divided into dens according to grade level. Dens\nwill consist of 5-8 boys. Each den will have at least one BSA-registered adult\nleader and assistant leader.\n\n\nAny boy who is 5 years old or in Kindergarten may join Cub Scouts. Ranks are as\nfollows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\n\n\nGrade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLion\n\n\nKindergarten\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiger\n\n\n1st Grade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWolf\n\n\n2nd Grade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBear\n\n\n3rd Grade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebelos\n\n\n4th Grade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArrow of Light\n\n\n5th Grade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach Scout needs a BSA Scout book for his rank. The book outlines the program\nfor the year and specific rank requirements.\n\n\nDen Meetings\n\n\nDays, times, and locations of den meetings are determined by the Den Leader and\nden parents.\n\n\nDen Leaders are responsible for coordinating den activities; however, parents\nwill be called upon to assist as needed. This may mean helping with a den\nmeeting or providing snacks. Your den leader will hold a parent meeting to\ndiscuss parent participation and support.\n\n\nDue to BSA Youth Protection Guidelines, \nno den meeting may take place without\ntwo-deep adult leadership\n. This means one registered Scout volunteer and at\nleast one other adult must be present at any den activity. \nThere are no\nexceptions to this rule.\n\n\nPack Meetings\n\n\nPack meetings are held on the 3rd Wednesday of each month during the school\nyear. Pack 1158 meets in the cafeteria of Ashburn Elementary School from\n7:00-8:00pm.\n\n\nAll boys should wear their Class A uniforms to the Pack meetings. Pack meetings\nare an opportunity for dens to gather and recognize the achievements of other\nScouts (or their own achievements). Pack meetings begin with a flag ceremony,\nusually followed by Scout skits, announcements, and presentations of awards.\n\n\nAward ceremonies are an important part of Pack 1158 meetings. Pack leaders\nstrive to make rank ceremonies as memorable as possible. Please make every\neffort to ensure your son\u2019s and your attendance at these meetings. Family\nattendance is also encouraged at Pack meetings. Boys love to get awards and to\nbe recognized in front of their family. Each Scout must have at least one\nparent or guardian in attendance.\n\n\nUniform\n\n\nBSA Field Uniform\n\n\nThe BSA Field uniform (formally known as Class A, detailed below) should be\nworn to all official Scout functions: den meetings, pack meetings, field trips,\netc., unless otherwise noted by the den leader. Scouts can also wear their\nuniform to school on pack meeting day. BSA Field uniforms must include all\nitems (as listed). Scout pants are not required, but green, navy, or khaki\npants/shorts must be worn. Sweat pants, running pants, sport uniform\npants/shorts, swim gear or athletic shorts of any kind are NOT acceptable.\nSneaker and hiking boots are accepted as footwear.

The committee selects leaders, performs record keeping, manages pack\n  finances, orders badges, maintains pack equipment, helps train leaders, and\n  recognizes leaders.

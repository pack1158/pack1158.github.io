With all the negative\ninfluences in today\u2019s society, Scouting provides your son with a positive peer\ngroup and a program that is fun and adventurous and helps him to \u201cbe prepared\u201d\nto shape his own future.\n\n\nScout Basics\n\n\nYour Boy is a Member of a \nDen\n (he will be assigned an existing den or a new\nden will be formed).\n\n\n\n\nA den has usually up to 8 boys\n\n\nThe den meets 2-3 times a month\n\n\nThe den is led by a den leader and an assistant (parents or adults connected\n  to boys in the Pack).\n\n\nThe den may also be assisted by a den chief (an older Boy Scout).\n\n\n\n\nYour Boy (and his Den) is a Member of a \nPack\n (we are Pack 1158).\n\n\n\n\nA pack is made up of all the dens.\n\n\nThe pack meets once a month (the 3rd Wednesday of each month at 7pm at\n  Ashburn Elementary School). All Cub Scout families attend.\n\n\nPack meetings have games, skits, songs, ceremonies, and presentations of\n  badges that the boys earned that month.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pack is Run by the \nPack Committee\n \n\n\n\n\nThe pack committee is made up of a group of adults that administer the\n  program of the pack. Usually committee members, as well as other pack\n  leaders, are parents or family of boys in the pack.\n\n\nThe committee meets once month (1st Wednesday of each month at 7pm at AES).\n\n\nThe committee is led by a Committee Chairperson.\n\n\nThe committee selects leaders, performs record keeping, manages pack\n  finances, orders badges, maintains pack equipment, helps train leaders, and\n  recognizes leaders.\n\n\n\n\nThe Pack is Owned by the \nChartered Organization\n (our Organization is the\nDulles International Airport Rotary Club).\n\n\n\n\nChartered organizations include schools, parent-school associations,\n  religious organizations, service clubs, and other groups interested in\n  youth.\n\n\nThe chartered organization approves leaders, provides a meeting place, and\n  operates packs within the guidelines and policies of the chartered\n  organization and the Boy scouts of America.\n\n\n\n\nPack Structure\n\n\nWithin each Pack, the boys are divided into dens according to grade level. Dens\nwill consist of 5-8 boys. Each den will have at least one BSA-registered adult\nleader and assistant leader.\n\n\nAny boy who is 5 years old or in Kindergarten may join Cub Scouts.

This may mean helping with a den\nmeeting or providing snacks. Your den leader will hold a parent meeting to\ndiscuss parent participation and support.\n\n\nDue to BSA Youth Protection Guidelines, \nno den meeting may take place without\ntwo-deep adult leadership\n.
